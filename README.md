This repository includes some Python scripts I've written. The data_analysis folder consists of scripts I wrote while working on my [master's thesis](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:hulib-202206152518) and as a research assistant for the University of Helsinki Phonetics and Speech Synthesis Research Group. The scripts are used for data-analysis, visualization and text annotation. As the datasets are not public, you cannot run the all the scripts on your own. The coursework folder contains some assignments I completed for language technology courses at the university.

Necessary Python libraries can be installed by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your environment.

Here's some examples of the PCA visualization and the web-interface I made for the speech synthesizer:
