This repository includes some Python scripts I've written. The data_analysis folder consists of scripts I wrote while working on my [master's thesis](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:hulib-202206152518) and as a research assistant for the University of Helsinki [Phonetics and Speech Synthesis Research Group](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/phonetics/). The scripts are used for data-analysis, visualization and text annotation. The full datasets are not publicly available, but I have added small example datasets that will demonstrate how the scripts work. The coursework folder contains a couple of web scapers I made at a language technology course at the university.

*After cloning the repository, necessary Python libraries can be installed by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the folder. You might want to create a separate, e.g. conda, environment (I have used Python version 3.10.9) especially as some of the scripts require older versions of some packages.*

Here's some examples of the PCA visualization and the web-interface I made for the speech synthesizer:
